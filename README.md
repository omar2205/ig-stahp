# Stop IG from autoplaying videos

I don't use it that much, but I hate it when sites do that.


## How it works?

Every time you scroll (there is a delay) it parses the whole site and remove every video element's source. This stops the video from playing, and prevent the browser from requesting that video (Saves bandwidth).


## How to install/use?

Still testing this. Will update.


## Features

[x] Stops vidoes from autoplaying
[ ] Play video when user click play
