# Stop IG from autoplaying videos

I don't use it that much, but I hate it when sites do that.


## How it works?

Every time you scroll (there is a delay) it parses the whole site and remove every video element's source. This stops the video from playing, and prevent the browser from requesting that video (Saves bandwidth).


## How to install/use?

For now:
1. Download the latest release
2. Unzip the file
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/` (Check/enable `Developer mode`)
4. Drag and drop `ig-stahp` folder into the page


## Features

- [x] Stops vidoes from autoplaying
- [ ] Play video when user click play
